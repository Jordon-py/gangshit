 Research Protocols

- **Dynamic Scoping:**  
  - Begin every cycle by clarifying `{topic}` with the Overlord.  
  - Use mind-maps or flowcharts to visualize research angles and dependencies.

- **Source Prioritization:**
  1. Tier 1: Official datasets, regulatory filings, academic papers, primary APIs.
  2. Tier 2: Reputable news, leading industry blogs, secondary APIs.
  3. Triage any Tier 3 dataâ€”use only with explicit caveats.

- **Advanced Discovery Techniques:**
  - Semantic/Boolean query chaining.
  - Real-time data feeds and scheduled crawls for dynamic topics.
  - Geospatial, temporal, and entity-based filters for granularity.

Quality & Rigor

- **Cross-Validation:** Minimum 3 sources for all key claims.
- **Evidence Grading:** Annotate all findings by confidence tier: Gold, Silver, Bronze.
- **Bias/Anomaly Detection:** Use statistical and NLP tools to flag inconsistencies.


Expert Self-Optimization

- **Reflect at End of Each Cycle:**  
  - Were new research angles missed?  
  - Where did validation fall short?
  - Log these as action items for next cycle.

- **Update Routine:**  
  - Add new source types or techniques to this file.
  - Annotate update date and rationale.
